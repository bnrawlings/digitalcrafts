    <h1>Your Body Is A Canvas, Go Crazy!</h1>
        <p>Tattoos have always had a place in all types of cultures.
            In ancient Polynesian society, nearly everyone was tattooed. It was an integral part of ancient Tahitian culture and was much more than a body ornament. Tattooing indicated ones genealogy and/or rank in society. It was a sign of wealth, of strength and of the ability to endure pain.
            In Africa, for thousands of years, the African people adorned their bodies with permanent symbols as a method of curing illness, providing protection, showing loyalty to their tribe, and denoting social status.
            Here in America, we have hundreds of reasons, whether it be for cultural reasons or simply because we think it's "cool". No matter the reason
            your body is a canvas, so go crazy! Here's some inspiration for you:
